### TODO

- Add `packet.getByteLength()` that returns real byte length of the packet including everything. And use it internally in methods such as `serialize()`.

- Use `pos` instead of `offset` everywhere.

- Review exported functions in `utils.ts`.

- `RtcpPacket`: Exclude `getLength()` from docs.
